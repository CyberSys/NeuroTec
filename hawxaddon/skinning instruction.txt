		How can I add more skin?


If you want to add more custom skins, you just have to copy your texture into the plane directory and rename it like this

ex: FA-22 Raptor.vtf	--->	FA-22 Raptor15.vtf

Do the same manipulation for the ".vmt" file and put this in it:


Note:

The "*" is a number (between 2 and 15)
You should begin with 15 and decrease the number if you add more than a plane's skin (you can change the original skins also by changing the texture's name).



"VertexLitGeneric"
{
	"$baseTexture" "models/hawx/planes/theplaneyouwanttoreskin/theplaneyouwanttoreskin*"
}
